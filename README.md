### TODO

#### Core functionality

Strike-through option from evaluate

	Should give an option to choose from all not set fields and select one

		Could be in a dropdown list, so it is same size as everything else

#### QoL

Sort Dice between Re-rolls

Print entire results

	Change Player Score section to this, including total current score at bottom.

	Could also show if bonus is attained or not during playthrough

#### Refactor

Player refactor (not use -1 as default values)

#### Css

Color-code dice

Change default text-size and look (text_shadow with backgrounds)

Dice textures (look like dice)

Better design for showing amount of rerolls (Atleast show what the number means)

Better looking buttons

Background, Padding, defaults: 
	Example 
	`* {
		color: black;
		display: block;
		font-size: 9pt;
		background-color: white;
	}`

#### Network

Server-client connected system

Replace checkbox reroll loop with Array of booleans
